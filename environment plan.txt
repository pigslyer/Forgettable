a tunnel with a broken down cart, with its lights flashing on and off
a big science room with a one way mirror looking into a testing area
a section of the facility that's been quarantined off. there are no enemies here, only the ghosts of those who died
a holding cell and holding cell shower
the escape elevator
the main long term volunteer storage area
