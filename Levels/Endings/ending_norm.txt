/talking_to Amnesiac

I've achieved freedom.
Now what? I'm left empty. My purpose is vacous, my path unset.
I walk along a path surrounded on all sides by trees, leaves are strewn around my feet... yet I sense no forest.
Earl? Vlad? Lorelei? Werther, are you here...? No, no one and no thing. I am surrounded by blackness.
If there's nobody to see me, do I even exist? Do I even achieve the lofty heights of being someone's memory?
I am left as forgotten as my past.
