Finally. Soon, this place will be nothing but a bad dream to me, and a vast emptiness to everyone else.
Pain is the only feeling that confirms existence. I've snuffed out their lives, rid them of their potential.
This journey is unforgettable, to me anyway.
You probably don't care though, do you?
{
    ::I do. It was an interesting journey.
    If you say so.

    ::Nah.
    Thought not.
}

So, what do I have to do now, Earl?

/talking_to Earl
Heh, now it's time for you to repay me for all my people you killed.
To start off with, there's a bitch named Nasif I want you to knock off.

/talking_to Amnesiac
She'll be deader than Elvis.

{
    ::Have fun kiddo.
    ::Good luck.

    Thank you.
