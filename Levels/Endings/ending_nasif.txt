/talking_to Amnesiac

Knowledge of my past informs my future. I was sent here to sabotage and destroy... but I leave, having done neither.
My goals unachieved, I look to the future. Is there any recourse but to fix my mistakes? 
Are they even mine, or do they belong to another, one with a name?

Kid, what in the unholy fuck are you on about? 
Look, I've got a job for you, now either you mope down there or you get up and do something with yourself.

As you command.
