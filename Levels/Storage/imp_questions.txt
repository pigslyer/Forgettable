:Hey...
{
    :::Do you think Earl is trustworthy?
    What I think doesn't much matter. Or it shouldn't, anyway. But my two cents are this. 
    Earl is gonna take care of you for as long as he likes you and deems you interesting.
    I think you're pretty interesting to him, what with who you were and everything. As such, I think he likes you.
    Anyway, what do you think?
    {
        ::He seems trustworthy to me.
        :He doesn't seem the type to push you off a cliff, y'know?
        Well, he has done that on multiple ocassions, but that's just splitting hairs.
        Anyway, I hope all goes well for you.

        ::There's something off about him.
        :I still don't understand why he needs my help. He seems perfectly capable of talking to you monsters on his own.
        Monsters?
        :I'm talking to an overweight imp sitting atop a throne of bones in an emptied meat locker. I think the word is apt.
        Good point... anyway, Earl probably wants to make sure you're ready to work for him.
        :Work for him?
        You'll find out once you escape.

        :::Who I was? Who was I?!
        I know you don't remember.
        How's this? Later on, I'll need your help. If you'll help me, I'll lead you to the answer.
        Back on topic though. What do you think?
    }
    :::Where is the Prison Cell Control Key?
    Why do you need it?
    {
        ::I'd like to check if anyone else is still locked up.
        ::None of your business.
    }
    I don't know. Try to find one of the scientists who worked in that area. They might have the key.
    ::Nothing else.
