:Before I go...
{
	:::What's my reward gonna be?
	Knowledge of your past.
	Or the key to it, at least.

	:::Your rebels?
	Heh, yeah... some of my followers have started deserting for reasons I'd rather not go into.
	Don't worry, they're dead to me.
	{
		::If you say so...

		::So you haven't got anyone?
		:Excluding this shmuck, obviously.

		/talking_to Follower
		Hey!

		/action update_name
		Oh no, I've still got some smart agents scouting around inside the Anomalous Materials area, people like you.
		Most of the rebels are just grunts that I could mostly scare into submission. 
		They aren't clever enough to think with their own heads.

	} 

	:::Who is this guy?
	He's a follower I sent to scout out Werther. He's informed me that he does, in fact, have an ally.
	Who was it again?

	/talking_to Follower
	A government spook. Apparently he was sent in on a rescue mission before Werther got to him.
	
	/action update_name
	He's also started searching for explosives.
	:Is that why you want me to get them? To keep them out of his hands?
	Nah, I actually do need them for my own needs. But yes, I would rather he didn't blow up my realm.

	::That's all, thanks.
