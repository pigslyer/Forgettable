/talking_to Fatty

So you're Earl's new plaything, eh?
I wonder how long until he discards you...
:Alright, Fatty, Earl sent me-
Hey, hey, hey, who you callin' Fatty?
Don't you know it's very rude to make fun o' someone like that?
{
	::Oh, my apologies. What shall I call you?
	Vlad'll suffice.
	/action called_vlad
	:Alright Vlad, as I was saying.

	::Why should I care, fat ass?
	/action called_fatty
	Oh, come on? Why do you have to be so childish?

	{
		::I don't. That's why it's funny.
		No, it isn't!
		:Yes it is.
		Your fatphobia's nothing more 'n a defense mechanism with which you seek to disguise the fact that you lack all control.
		You're like a child using a magnifyin' glass on an insect in order to distract 'imself from his family's abuse.
		You are nothing, if not less.
		{
			::Alright, you've made your point.
			In that case, what were you saying?
			::Yeah, and you're much, much more, fatty.
			Fuck.
			You.
		}

		::You're so fat, your farts fall under a 6.9 on the Richter scale.
		/end
	}
}

:Earl wants me to go talk to Lorelei, but I'm pretty sure that there's some psychos in the way to Medical.
:I want to know if there's a way past them or if you can provide me with a way through them.
What's Earl want with Lorelei?
{
	::She stole his pipe.
	She stole Earl's PIPE?! Now that's funny.
	He will never live that down. I won't let him.

	::None of your business.
	Now that's no way to treat someone who you're asking for help.
	But if you wanna be cagey...
}
Anywho, there's no other path to Medical than through them. Luckily for you though, I can arm you.

/update Get gun from Vlad's Stash!
Here. That'll unlock my Stash - the door opposite this room. Inside you'll find a gun and some ammo.
Good luck.
{
	::Thank you.
	::You're giving me this for free?
	I'm in a good mood.
	For a more tangible reason, I assume your ultimate goal is escape - I don't know what else it'd be.
	As such, you'll have to come back to help me anyway, so your survival is a good investment.
