I'm telling you sir, he's got someone else.

Hm... Interesting. But Earl's servant's come to us.
What is it?

    ::I need a way past the mines in the entrance hall.
    Ah, those things.

    ::What're you two meeting about?
    None o' your concern. Now, what's it you want?
    :The mines in  the entrance hall are giving Earl and I trouble.
    I'd imagine you moreso than Earl.

}

I'll tell you how to get past 'em, but you'll have to return the favor.

    ::Of course.
    ::Haven't got a choice.
    :It's either helping you or going back to my cell.

/update Find the Mine Detector in the Railway!
Alright, what you're looking for is down in the Railway.
Head out of my throne room and take two lefts, it's the door at the end of the hall.
You'll have to fight your way through my rebels to get there. Their base of operations is a broken down train.
They've installed a keypad lock inside, the code to which I've been led to believe is 8730.
Write that down somewhere, 8730.
Now, for my favor. Along with the MD they've also got some plastic explosives somewhere.
Find 'em and bring them back to me and I'll reward you.
