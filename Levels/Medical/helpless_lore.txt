:Gimme a sec.

    :::Do you know who I was?
    Huh? What do you mean?
    :I don't remember.
    Oh... ow.
    Alright, I don't know either. One day we just found you in one of the cells.
    Nasif said that you'd volunteered.
    {
        ::That can't be right.
        :I don't think I'd ever want to be locked up.

        ::Why would I have volunteered?
        :I mean, why would I want to be put in a cell?
    }
    Uh... huh...

    :::Whose followers are you?
    What?
    :Yeah, which monster do you follow?
    :Werther? Lorelei? Maybe Imp?
    We didn't follow any of them.

    :::What happened to you?
    We tried to escape using the elevator.
    But we had to get past the blockade in the corridor.
    We tried some explosives but I hurt myself.

    :::How do I get to the last office?
    Nasif's? I don't know.
    We don't have the key. Maybe one of the monsters took it?
    /action asked

    :::Were you scientists aware of the monsters?
    What monsters?
    :For example the big squid monster that's in the shower room.
    We didn't see any back then.
    Nasif always told us to dismiss your cries as acts of desperation.

    ::I'll kill you.
    Thank you...

    ::I won't kill you.
    Please...
