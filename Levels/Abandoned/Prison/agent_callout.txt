:Hello? Is anyone here? 
/talking_to ???
HEY! CAN YOU HEAR ME?! PLEASE LET ME OUT!
Please...
Just help me... 
:Uh, sir? Are you okay? 
Do I fucking sound okay?! Let me out! 
{
	::Hold up now. How do I know I can trust you?  
	Are you fucking kidding me? 
	:I don't really feel like being strangled to death by a maniac in a cell. 
	Wait, no, please don't leave! I can offer you something you'll surely be interested in! 
	:And what might that be? 
	Open the cell and I'll tell you. 
	:...
	:Fine. Just don't go trying anything funny, okay? I promise, it won't end well for you. 

	::I'll get on that. 
	Thank you. I thought I'd die in this godforsaken shithole. I'll reward you for your efforts, I promise. 
}
You'll probably find the key further ahead. Hell, that fat fuck might know where it is.
