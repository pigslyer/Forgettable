/talking_to Earl

:I have the mine detector.
Good job, puppy. Now, to stage two.
While you were in those tunnels I was able to figure out who Werther's helper is.
He was some sorta' agent who was sent in here to rescue someone, but Werther got into his head.
{
    ::Who the hell was he sent in here to rescue?
    Ehm, I don't know.
    {
        ::You sure you don't know Earl? 
        :I mean, you know an awful lot about everyone's dirty little secrets.
        Mhm.
        :So?
        I'm not budging.
        :Fantastic. And you expect me to trust you.

        ::Alright then.
    }

    ::And I assume he's gonna get in our way?
    Sorta. He's heard of your capabilities and wants to meet.
    He seems to think that you're crazy enough to want to blow this place up.
    {
        ::How would I do that?
        He knows you went to Fatty's rebels and that they had a stash of C4.

        ::Crazy, yeah...
        :I mean, who'd want to blow up this wonderful place filled with sunshine and happiness.
    }
}

Anyway, he's in the Test Chamber Viewing room.
Don't let him get a word in edgewise, just shoot 'im dead.
:Why?
He's got the keycode to a vent through which you can get to the Entrance zone.
:And how am I supposed to get it if he's dead?
Ehm, trust me, he probably has it written somewhere.
/update Get keycode from Bomber.
