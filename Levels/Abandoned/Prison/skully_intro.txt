:Huh? Where am I? 
:Ah, back at the cell. 
:For how long have I been trapped in here? 
:Days? Months? Years, even? God knows. 
:Ugh. I can barely lift my arms and legs. 
:Where are the damn guards? 
:I wish someone would bring me some food. 
:I can't even remember when the last time that I got a proper meal was.  
:I'm alone, so alone. And cold, too. 
:Like... a fly on a window, desperately banging its head against the glass, but to no avail. 
:If only I could-

/talking_to Skull
Howdy, son!
:Ah, it's you again. 
Damn right it's me again! Who else d'you expect? 
:... 
{
	::What exactly are you? 
	A floating skull, that's what I am. 
	Ain't that funny? 

	::It's weird seeing you without your pipe. 
	Hah, ain't that the truth! 
	:Why did you keep distracting me during the trials? They beat me because of that, you know. 
	I was simply observing you, kid. Ain't my damn fault you got distracted. 

	::...
	Well, uhm. Nice seeing ya around these parts, son. 
}
Anyway, I think 'twas about time I introduced myself. 
/talking_to Earl
The name's Earl, and oh boy, do I got a little job for ya. 
Ya see, there's this... How should I call it... *friend* of mine, and well... 
I got me a nice pipe a while ago, and she seems to like it a lot, 'cause she took it for herself. I know, I shoulda been more careful. But you'll get it back for me, won't ya son?
:Why don't you just get it yourself? 
It ain't right for a gentleman to bother a lady like that. 
Besides, where's the fun in that? Might as well send ya instead and enjoy the show. 
:Well, what's in it for me? 
:You can't possibly expect me to do this for free. 
:Not to mention the fact that I'm still locked in this fucking cell. How am I supposed to get your pipe anyway? 
Don't ya worry about a thing, son. 
I'll get it open right away.
/action open_cell
;...
Now, lemme explain it all for ya. No, don't try to interrupt me. 
See, Lorelai's got some... fans. They're real killjoys, every last one of them, and a bit mad too. So the halls ain't safe cos of 'em an' all. 
You'll need a weapon if you wanna deal with them, and a proper one at that. A gun would be best, I think. 
They might be crazy but even they will think twice if you point a gun at 'em. 
:Of course.
Once you step out of the cell, you'll need to go through the kitchen and then the storage area of the facility. 
There, you'll probably see an Imp. Don't mind the fucker - he knows not to bother my... ehm, accomplices.
Hell, he might even let you take a gander at his stash, if you butter him up right... Or if you let him butter you up.
:What?
He eats people, kiddo.
:I still don't see why the hell I should help you with this.  
Well for one, if ya don't you'll stay stuck in this damn cell. And I can guarantee you - it'll be worse than the experiments. 
Oh, and did I mention how I'll help you escape the facility if you do this for me? 
:Why would you help me with that? One pipe surely can't be worth all this trouble. 
Heh, I guess I just always wanted a minion in the outside world. 
Ya know, someone who would do my bidding. 
Now get going, this pipe ain't just magically gonna appear back in my mouth, son.
