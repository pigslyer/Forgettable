Ah, thank you again. Now for the reward. 
There's a powerful weapon in the Confiscated Materials room. The code is 2979. I'm sure it will serve you well.
Write it down if you need help remembering it! 2979! 
:Thank you.
Don't sweat it. Could you get me out if this damn chair, friend?

	Fuck, this feels good. Now, if you'll excuse me. I feel like I need to go... Somewhere. 
	:So you've heard her too, huh? I suggest you don't do that. She's, well, very dangerous. 
	Pha! You don't have to worry about me. I admit, they got me good, but hell, I ain't done yet. I was sent here on a rescue mission for fuck's sake! 
	/talking_to Agent 
	Now, if I were you, I'd go check out the Confiscated Materials room. Oh, and if you see any of the other agents, do help them, will you? 

	::Do nothing 
	Hey, come back! Don't you dare to leave you fucking piece of shit!
