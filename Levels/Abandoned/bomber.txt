/talking_to Bomber

You. You're Earl's helper, aren't you? I'm a fan of your work.
:And you're Werther's.
{
    ::Can't say the feeling's mutual.
    ::The feeling's mutual.
}
We both need to do something for our Masters. Are you willing to help?
:You're asking if I want to blow this place up for you?
Yeah.
{
    ::Count me in.
    Alright, so... um, you should have some explosives, right?
    {
        ::Yeah.
        Great!
        ::I still need to grab them.
        Alright, well, they should be in the Railway. I'll tell you the plan anyway and you can realize it later.

    Right, so, you're gonna have to plant a bomb in every sector.
    You should probably put one outside the corridor between the Prison and Testing Area here.
    The next you should place somewhere in the Storage corridor intersection, then one at the front of the train in the Railway.
    And finally a bomb on either of the two sides of the bombed out corridor in Medical.
    {
        ::Doable.
        ::What have I gotten myself into?
    }

    ::Fuck no.
    I have no choice then...
    Draw!
