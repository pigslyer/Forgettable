/talking_to Lorelei
  
:Hey! 
Oh my, you're back! Welcome, why don't you come closer?
:I'm not here to play your games again. 
:I released an agent guy from a prison cell earlier. He said he could hear you calling.
{
	::Where the fuck is he now, huh?! Why don't you tell me that? 
	Now then, it's not right to yell at others like that! I genuinely tried, I promise. He was just too inviting. 
	:You really are fucked up in the head, aren't you? 

	::I'm sure he ran into you at some point. Any idea where he might be?
	I do, unfortunately. You see, he came here, and we had a lovely conversation, but then... 
	Oh, I couldn't possibly resist it, the urge was simply too strong. 
	:You disgust me. 
	
	::I suppose it's too late for him now, though. A shame. 
}
Hey now, don't just walk away from me like that! I really am sorry, I promise! I wish I could have stopped myself. 
Wait, no! Please don't go! I'm so lonely, you can't just leave me here! You're the only thing I've got. Please come back...
