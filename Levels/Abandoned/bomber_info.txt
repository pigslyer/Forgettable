:Before I go...
{
    :::Will you give me the keycode I need?
    Yeah, once you've planted all of them I'll tell you the key to the vent through which you can get past the cave-in.
    {
        ::Will Werther be any trouble?
        Of course not. With your help we'll blow up this whole floor and probably cause a good deal of destruction in the others.
        Power outages, tremors, the works.
        He'll be satisfied, disable the minefield and let you flee.
        :Great.

        ::Alright, thanks.
    }
    Just come back once you're done.

    :::What were the bombsites?
    You should plant one outside the corridor between the Prison and Testing Area here.
    The next you should place somewhere in the Storage corridor intersection, then one at the front of the train in the Railway.
    And finally a bomb on either of the two sides of the bombed out corridor in Medical.

    :::You sound... off.
    What do you mean?
    {
        ::You sounded more... intimidating.
        :When others spoke of you, I mean.
        
        ::Nevermind.
    }

    :::What's your name?
    My... name? I... Hm... I don't know.
    I can't seem to remember it.

    ::Thanks, that'll be all.
}
