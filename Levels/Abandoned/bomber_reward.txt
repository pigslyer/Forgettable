/talking_to Bomber

:Alright, I've planted all the bombs.
Thank you.
:Now for my reward.
Yes. The code to the vent leading from Medical to the Entrance Zone is 3321.
You should write that down if you can't remember it! 3321!

{
    ::Now what are you going to do?
    I'd never considered it... I guess my next step is discovering my past.
    I don't remember anything but the last couple of days working with Werther.
    {
        :::Won't you die here?!
        I will. But I still have some time before the bombs trigger.

        ::Good luck.
        Thanks.

        ::You shouldn't.
        Huh?
        {
            ::Your past doesn't matter.
            :You should just enjoy your final moments.

            ::Your past will always disappoint you.
            :You should look to the future. We could escape together.

            No, you don't understand, I NEED to know.
            {
                ::If you say so.
                ::I understand all too well.
            }
            :Farewell.
        }

    }

    ::So long.
}

Before you go, what are you going to do? Once you escape, I mean.
{
    ::Serve Earl.
    ::Help Earl.
    ::Work for Earl.
}
Hm, glad you've got your future figured out.
Good luck and goodbye.
